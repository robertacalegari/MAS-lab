	Abstract = {This work presents ACLT, a coordination model aimed to combine and coordinate heterogeneous agents by means of a communication abstraction inspired to the Linda model, but rooted in a logic framework. The twofold interpretation of a logic tuple space both as a message and as a knowledge repository naturally induces a categorisation of agents as logic and non-logic. While non-logic agents adopt the basic Linda kernel, logic agents exploit the full power of the ACLT model, which supports deduction and reasoning over the content of the tuple space. By providing a conceptual framework where logic inference and temporal tuple space evolution coexist, ACLT provides a suitable environment to build heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where hybrid agent architectures can be designed, integrating reasoning capabilities together with reactive behaviours.},

Linda has been used as a coordination layer to parallelize several sequential programming languages, such as C and Scheme. In this paper we study the combination of Linda with a logic language, whose result is the language Extended Shared Prolog (ESP). We show that ESP is based on a new programming model called PoliS, that extends Linda with Multiple Tuple Spaces. A class of applications for ESP is discussed, introducing the concept of ``open multiple tuple spaces''. Finally, we show how the distributed implementation of ESP uses the network version of Linda's tuple space.},

	Abstract = {Shared Prolog is a new concurrent logic language. A Shared Prolog system is composed of a set of parallel agents that are Prolog programs extended by a guard mechanism. The programmer controls the granularity of parallelism, coordinating communication and synchronization of the agents via a centralized data structure. The communication mechanism is inherited from the blackboard model of problem solving. Intuitively, the granularity of the logic processes to be elaborated in parallel is large, while the resources shared on the blackboard can be very fined grained. An operational semantics for Shared Prolog is given in terms of a distributed model. Through an abstract notion of computation, the kinds of parallelism supported by the language, as well as properties of infinite computations, such as local deadlocks, are studied. The expressiveness of the language is shown with respect to the specification of two classes of applications: metaprogramming and blackboard systems.},

One view of multi-agent system design is that coordination is achieved via an interaction model in which participating agents assume roles constrained by the social norms of their shared task; the state of the interaction reflecting the ways these constraints are mutually satisfied within some system for synchronisation that is open and distributed. We show how to harness a process calculus; constraint solving; unfolding and meta-variables for this purpose and discuss the advantages of these methods over traditional approaches.},

	Abstract = {Concurrent logic languages are high-level programming languages for parallel and distributed systems that offer a wide range of both known and novel concurrent programming techniques. Being logic programming languages, they preserve many advantages of the abstract logic programming model, including the logical reading of programs and computations, the convenience of representing data structures with logical terms and manipulating them using unification, and the amenability to metaprogramming. Operationally, their model of computation consists of a dynamic set of concurrent processes, communicating by instantiating shared logical variables, synchronizing by waiting for variables to be instantiated, and making nondeterministic choices, possibly based on the availability of values of variables. This paper surveys the family of concurrent logic programming languages within a uniform operational framework. It demonstrates the expressive power of even the simplest language in the family and investigates how varying the basic synchronization and control constructs affect the expressiveness and efficiency of the resulting languages. In addition, the paper reports on techniques for sequential and parallel implementation of languages in this family, mentions their applications to date, and relates these languages to the abstract logic programming model, to the programming language PROLOG, and to other concurrent computational models and programming languages.},

	Abstract = {Aurora is a prototype or-parallel implementation of the full Prolog language for shared-memory multiprocessors, developed as part of an informal research collaboration known as the ``Gigalips Project''. It currently runs on Sequent and Encore machines. It has been constructed by adapting Sicstus Prolog, a fast, portable, sequential Prolog system. The techniques for constructing a portable multiprocessor version follow those pioneered in a predecessor system, ANL-WAM. The SRI model was adopted as the means to extend the Sicstus Prolog engine for or-parallel operation. We describe the design and main implementation features of the current Aurora system, and present some experimental results. For a range of benchmarks, Aurora on a 20-processor Sequent Symmetry is 4 to 7 times faster than Quintus Prolog on a Sun 3/75. Good performance is also reported on some large-scale Prolog applications.},

	Abstract = {Since the early days of logic programming, researchers in the field realized the potential for exploitation of parallelism present in the execution of logic programs. Their high-level nature, the presence of nondeterminism, and their referential transparency, among other characteristics, make logic programs interesting candidates for obtaining speedups through parallel execution. At the same time, the fact that the typical applications of logic programming frequently involve irregular computations, make heavy use of dynamic data structures with logical variables, and involve search and speculation, makes the techniques used in the corresponding parallelizing compilers and run-time systems potentially interesting even outside the field. The objective of this article is to provide a comprehensive survey of the issues arising in parallel execution of logic programming languages along with the most relevant approaches explored to date in the field. Focus is mostly given to the challenges emerging from the parallel execution of Prolog programs. The article describes the major techniques used for shared memory implementation of Or-parallelism, And-parallelism, and combinations of the two. We also explore some related issues, such as memory management, compile-time analysis, and execution visualization.},

	Abstract = {Cloud computing is a buzz-word in today's information technology (IT) that nobody can escape. But what is really behind it? There are many interpretations of this term, but no standardized or even uniform definition. Instead, as a result of the multi-faceted viewpoints and the diverse interests expressed by the various stakeholders, cloud computing is perceived as a rather fuzzy concept. With this book, the authors deliver an overview of cloud computing architecture, services, and applications. Their aim is to bring readers up to date on this technology and thus to provide a common basis for discussion, new research, and novel application scenarios. They first introduce the foundation of cloud computing with its basic technologies, such as virtualization and Web services. After that they discuss the cloud architecture and its service modules. The following chapters then cover selected commercial cloud offerings (including Amazon Web Services and Google App Engine) and management tools, and present current related open-source developments (including Hadoop, Eucalyptus, and Open CirrusTM). Next, economic considerations (cost and business models) are discussed, and an evaluation of the cloud market situation is given. Finally, the appendix contains some practical examples of how to use cloud resources or cloud applications, and a glossary provides concise definitions of key terms. The authors' presentation does not require in-depth technical knowledge. It is equally intended as an introduction for students in software engineering, web technologies, or business development, for professional software developers or system architects, and for future-oriented decision-makers like top executives and managers.},

	Url = {http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529260/},
	Year = 2007,
	Abstract = {You've built web sites that can be used by humans. But can you also build web sites that are usable by machines? That's where the future lies, and that's what RESTful Web Services shows you how to do. The World Wide Web is the most popular distributed application in history, and Web services and mashups have turned it into a powerful distributed computing platform. But today's web service technologies have lost sight of the simplicity that made the Web successful. They don't work like the Web, and they're missing out on its advantages.
	
	This book puts the Web back into web services. It shows how you can connect to the programmable web with the technologies you already use every day. The key is REST, the architectural style that drives the Web. This book:
	* Emphasizes the power of basic Web technologies -- the HTTP application protocol, the URI naming standard, and the XML markup language
	* Introduces the Resource-Oriented Architecture (ROA), a common-sense set of rules for designing RESTful web services
	* Shows how a RESTful design is simpler, more versatile, and more scalable than a design based on Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)
	* Includes real-world examples of RESTful web services, like Amazon's Simple Storage Service and the Atom Publishing Protocol
	* Discusses web service clients for popular programming languages
	* Shows how to implement RESTful services in three popular frameworks -- Ruby on Rails, Restlet (for Java), and Django (for Python)
	* Focuses on practical issues: how to design and implement RESTful web services and clients
	This is the first book that applies the REST design philosophy to real web services. It sets down the best practices you need to make your design a success, and the techniques you need to turn your design into working code. You can harness the power of the Web for programmable applications: you just have to work with the Web instead of against it. This book shows you how.},

	Abstract = {I present a method for reasoning about spatial relationships on the basis of entailments in propositional logic. Formalisms for representing topological and other spatial information (e.g. [2] [10] [11]) have generally employed the 1st-order predicate calculus. Whilst this language is much more expressive than 0-order (propositional ) calculi it is correspondingly harder to reason with. Hence, by encoding spatial relationships in a propositional representation automated reasoning becomes more effective. I specify representations in both classical and intuitionistic propositional logic, which --- together with well-defined meta-level reasoning algorithms --- provide for efficient reasoning about a large class of spatial relations.}}

Motivated by the needs of mobile augmented-reality applications, Spatial Tuples explicitly aims at supporting space-aware and space-based coordination in agent-based pervasive computing scenarios.},

	Abstract = {This survey characterizes an emerging research area, sometimes called coordination theory, that focuses on the interdisciplinary study of coordination. Research in this area uses and extends ideas about coordination from disciplines such as computer science, organization theory, operations research, economics, linguistics, and psychology. A key insight of the framework presented here is that coordination can be seen as the process of managing dependencies among activities. Further progress, therefore, should be possible by characterizing different kinds of dependencies and identifying the coordination processes that can be used to manage them. A variety of processes are analyzed from this perspective, and commonalities across disciplines are identified. Processes analyzed include those for managing shared resources, producer/consumer relationships, simultaneity constraints, and task/subtask dependencies. Section 3 summarizes ways of applying a coordination perspective in three different domains:(1) understanding the effects of information technology on human organizations and markets, (2) designing cooperative work tools, and (3) designing distributed and parallel computer systems. In the final section, elements of a research agenda in this new area are briefly outlined.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we consider a probabilistic method for mapping a spatial process over a distributed multi-agent system and a coordinated level curve tracking algorithm for adaptive sampling. As opposed to assuming the independence of spatial features (e.g. an occupancy grid model), we adopt a novel model of spatial dependence based on the grid-structured Markov random field that exploits spatial structure to enhance mapping. The multi-agent Markov random field framework is utilized to distribute the model over the system and to decompose the problem of global inference into local belief propagation problems coupled with neighbor-wise inter-agent message passing. A Lyapunov stable control law for tracking level curves in the plane is derived and a method of gradient and Hessian estimation is presented for applying the control in a probabilistic map of the process. Simulation results over a real-world dataset with the goal of mapping a plume-like oceanographic process demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms. Scalability and complexity results suggest the feasibility of the approach in realistic multi-agent deployments.},

This article focuses on the notions of ``place'' and ``conceptual spatial relation'' to present a formal model of space supporting common-sense spatial reasoning. The model can be viewed as the semantic specification for a hybrid logic, whose formulas represent spatially qualified information. Interesting classes of common-sense spatial models are identified according to the properties of their characteristic relations and an axiomatization of the associated hybrid language is given; a sound and complete tableau-based calculus for these classes of models is provided.},

Additionally, common problems in the context of real-world applications are identified, and it is shown how these can be addressed using the proposed approach. Furthermore, it is argued that a realization based on a multi-agent system offers advantages in terms of extensibility and flexibility. Finally, an exemplary implementation of a spatial reasoning system within an interactive tourist guide is presented along with its basic mechanisms and a short review of its performance in real world tasks.},

Spatial computing attempts to bridge this gap for systems with local communication by exploiting the connection between physical locality and device connectivity. A large number of spatial computing domain specific languages (DSLs) have emerged across diverse domains, from biology and reconfigurable computing, to sensor networks and agent-based systems. In this chapter, the authors develop a framework for analyzing and comparing spatial computing DSLs, survey the current state of the art, and provide a roadmap for future spatial computing DSL investigation.},

	Abstract = {The Proto spatial computing language simplifies the creation of scalable, robust, distributed programs by abstracting a network of locally communicating devices as a continuous geometric manifold. However, Proto's successful application in a number of domains is challenging its coherence across different platforms and distributions. We thus present a complete operational semantics for the Proto language, as executed asynchronously on a network of fast message-passing devices. This semantics covers all of the operations of the three space-time operator families unique to Proto - restriction, feedback, and neighborhood - as well as the current pointwise operations that it shares with most other languages. This formalization will provide a reference to aid implementers in preserving language coherence across platforms, domains, and distributions. The formalization process has also advanced the Proto language in several ways, which we explain in detail.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a study on urban data crowdsourcing driven by Geo-Zombie, a multimedia mobile application we designed and developed to engage pedestrians in taking note of urban architectural impediments and facilities by documenting them through pictures and multimedia data. Geo-Zombie aims at transforming the civic activity of contributing into a virtual gamified experience where players attempt to escape from horrific situations in which zombies are ready to cannibalize unsuspecting walkers. In some sense, walkers that kill zombies deeply reconnect with the concept of imminent danger which can be fought resorting to appropriate civic actions. To challenge our initial hypotheses we conducted a design process, starting with a concept generation where three different concepts were discussed which gave rise to five different multimedia mobile apps including the one with zombies. Then, focus group, experience prototyping, application design and implementation, and finally field trials were exploited to refine the design and to select the best apps out of the five that better responded to the need of involving common people in collecting urban accessibility data. It is worth noting that the experiences of use with 50 avid walkers have demonstrated that a multimedia mobile app with maps and zombies can be a concrete step towards a social inclusion strategy while inviting new reflections and discussions on the issue of urban data crowdsourcing.},

	Abstract = {Computational geometry emerged from the field of algorithms design and analysis in the late 1970s. It has grown into a recognized discipline with its own journals, conferences, and a large community of active researchers. The success of the field as a research discipline can on the one hand be explained from the beauty of the problems studied and the solutions obtained, and, on the other hand, by the many application domains---computer graphics, geographic information systems (GIS), robotics, and others---in which geometric algorithms play a fundamental role. For many geometric problems the early algorithmic solutions were either slow or difficult to understand and implement. In recent years a number of new algorithmic techniques have been developed that improved and simplified many of the previous approaches. In this textbook we have tried to make these modern algorithmic solutions accessible to a large audience. The book has been written as a textbook for a course in computational geometry, but it can also be used for self-study.},

(National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 1989, p. 48) Geometry is grasping space ... that space in which the child lives, breathes and moves. The space that the child must learn to knOw, explore, conquer; in order to live, breathe, and move better in it. (Freudenthal, in National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 1989, p. 48) Arising out of practical activity and man's need to describe his surroundings, geometric forms were slowly conceptualized until they took on an abstract meaning of their own. Thus from a practical theory of earth measure, there developed a growing set of relations or theorems that culminated in Euclid's Elements, the collection, synthesis, and elaboration of all this knowledge. (Fehr; 1973, p. 370) EquatiOns are just the boring part of mathematics. I attempt to see things in terms of geometry. (Hawking, National Research Council, 1989, p. 35) School},

	Abstract = {Since the early days of physics, space has called for means to represent, experiment, and reason about it. Apart from physicists, the concept of space has intrigued also philosophers, mathematicians and, more recently, computer scientists. This longstanding interest has left us with a plethora of mathematical tools developed to represent and work with space. Here we take a special look at this evolution by considering the perspective of Logic. From the initial axiomatic efforts of Euclid, we revisit the major milestones in the logical representation of space and investigate current trends. In doing so, we do not only consider classical logic, but we indulge ourselves with modal logics. These present themselves naturally by providing simple axiomatizations of different geometries, topologies, space-time causality, and vector spaces.},

	Abstract = {Comparatively little is known about the inherited primate background underlying human cognition, the human cognitive ``wild-type.'' Yet it is possible to trace the evolution of human cognitive abilities and tendencies by contrasting the skills of our nearest cousins, not just chimpanzees, but all the extant great apes, thus showing what we are likely to have inherited from the common ancestor [1]. By looking at human infants early in cognitive development, we can also obtain insights into native cognitive biases in our species [2]. Here, we focus on spatial memory, a central cognitive domain. We show, first, that all nonhuman great apes and 1-year-old human infants exhibit a preference for place over feature strategies for spatial memory. This suggests the common ancestor of all great apes had the same preference. We then examine 3-year-old human children and find that this preference reverses. Thus, the continuity between our species and the other great apes is masked early in human ontogeny. These findings, based on both phylogenetic and ontogenetic contrasts, open up the prospect of a systematic evolutionary psychology resting upon the cladistics of cognitive preferences.},

	Abstract = {It is a truism that much of human reasoning is approximate in nature. Spatial reasoning is an area where humans consistently reason approximately with demonstrably good results. The unique mental processes behind these actions are not well understood. However, it is important that we try to incorporate such approximate reasoning techniques in our computer systems. Approximate spatial reasoning is very important for intelligent mobile agents (e.g., robots), specially for those operating in uncertain or unknown or dynamic domains. In such situations, besides the hazard in the domain, the real constraints (e.g., limited memory and limited time for observations and/or inferencing) faced by agents makes the use of approximate reasoning techniques imperative. In this paper we present a model for approximate spatial reasoning using fuzzy logic to represent the uncertainty in the environment. We develop algorithms to reason about spatial information expressed in the form of approximate linguistic descriptions, very similar to the kind of spatial information processed by humans. We only deal with static spatial reasoning in this paper.},

	Abstract = {We carried out two experiments to investigate how people reason about the spatial relations among objects. The experiments were designed to test a theory of spatial inference based on mental models. The theory predicts that problems requiring only one model of the spatial layout to be constructed should be easier than those requiring more than one model to be constructed, even when the multiple-model problems have valid conclusions. A contrasting theory, based on rules of inference, predicts that problems based on fewer inferential steps should be easier than problems based on more steps. The first experiment held constant the number of inferential steps specified by the inference-rule theory, but varied the number of models required to make a valid response: the one-model problems were reliably easier than the problems requiring more than one model. The second experiment contrasted opposing predictions from the two theories, and once again the results supported the model-based theory.},

	Abstract = {Li and Gleitman (Turning the tables: language and spatial reasoning. Cognition, in press) seek to undermine a large-scale cross-cultural comparison of spatial language and cognition which claims to have demonstrated that language and conceptual coding in the spatial domain covary (see, for example, Space in language and cognition: explorations in linguistic diversity. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, in press; Language 74 (1998) 557): the most plausible interpretation is that different languages induce distinct conceptual codings. Arguing against this, Li and Gleitman attempt to show that in an American student population they can obtain any of the relevant conceptual codings just by varying spatial cues, holding language constant. They then argue that our findings are better interpreted in terms of ecologically-induced distinct cognitive styles reflected in language. Linguistic coding, they argue, has no causal effects on non-linguistic thinking -- it simply reflects antecedently existing conceptual distinctions. We here show that Li and Gleitman did not make a crucial distinction between frames of spatial reference relevant to our line of research. We report a series of experiments designed to show that they have, as a consequence, misinterpreted the results of their own experiments, which are in fact in line with our hypothesis. Their attempts to reinterpret the large cross-cultural study, and to enlist support from animal and infant studies, fail for the same reasons. We further try to discern exactly what theory drives their presumption that language can have no cognitive efficacy, and conclude that their position is undermined by a wide range of considerations.},

	Abstract = {This paper investigates possible influences of the lexical resources of individual languages on the spatial organization and reasoning styles of their users. That there are such powerful and pervasive influences of language on thought is the thesis of the Whorf--Sapir linguistic relativity hypothesis which, after a lengthy period in intellectual limbo, has recently returned to prominence in the anthropological, linguistic, and psycholinguistic literatures. Our point of departure is an influential group of cross-linguistic studies that appear to show that spatial reasoning is strongly affected by the spatial lexicon in everyday use in a community (e.g. Brown, P., {\&} Levinson, S. C. (1993). Linguistic and nonlinguistic coding of spatial arrays: explorations in Mayan cognition (Working Paper No. 24). Nijmegen: Cognitive Anthropology Research Group, Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics; Cognitive Linguistics 6 (1995) 33). Specifically, certain groups customarily use an externally referenced spatial-coordinate system to refer to nearby directions and positions (``to the north'') whereas English speakers usually employ a viewer-perspective system (``to the left''). Prior findings and interpretations have been to the effect that users of these two types of spatial system solve rotation problems in different ways, reasoning strategies imposed by habitual use of the language-particular lexicons themselves. The present studies reproduce these different problem-solving strategies in speakers of a single language (English) by manipulating landmark cues, suggesting that language itself may not be the key causal factor in choice of spatial perspective. Prior evidence on rotation problem solution from infants (e.g. Acredolo, L.P. (1979). Laboratory versus home: the effect of environment on the 9-month-old infant's choice of spatial reference system. Developmental Psychology, 15 (6), 666--667) and from laboratory animals (e.g. Restle, F. (1975). Discrimination of cues in mazes: a resolution of the place-vs.-response question. Psychological Review, 64, 217--228) suggests a unified interpretation of the findings: creatures approach spatial problems differently depending on the availability and suitability of local landmark cues. The results are discussed in terms of the current debate on the relation of language to thought, with particular emphasis on the question of why different cultural communities favor different perspectives in talking about space.},

	Year = 2002,
	Abstract = {Recent advances in miniaturization and low-cost, low-power design have led to active research in large-scale networks of small, wireless, low-power sensors and actuators. Time synchronization is critical in sensor networks for diverse purposes including sensor data fusion, coordinated actuation, and power-efficient duty cycling. Though the clock accuracy and precision requirements are often stricter than in traditional distributed systems, strict energy constraints limit the resources available to meet these goals.We present Reference-Broadcast Synchronization, a scheme in which nodes send reference beacons to their neighbors using physical-layer broadcasts. A reference broadcast does not contain an explicit timestamp; instead, receivers use its arrival time as a point of reference for comparing their clocks. In this paper, we use measurements from two wireless implementations to show that removing the sender's nondeterminism from the critical path in this way produces high-precision clock agreement (1.85 $\pm$ 1.28$\mu$sec, using off-the-shelf 802.11 wireless Ethernet), while using minimal energy. We also describe a novel algorithm that uses this same broadcast property to federate clocks across broadcast domains with a slow decay in precision (3.68 $\pm$ 2.57$\mu$sec after 4 hops). RBS can be used without external references, forming a precise relative timescale, or can maintain microsecond-level synchronization to an external timescale such as UTC. We show a significant improvement over the Network Time Protocol (NTP) under similar conditions.},

The accuracy is shown to be a function of the network transmission latency; it depends linearly upon the drift rate of the clocks and the interval between synchronizations. TEMPO keeps the clocks of the VAX computers in a local area network synchronized with an accuracy comparable to the resolution of single-machine clocks. Comparison with other clock synchronization algorithms shows that TEMPO, in an environment with no Byzantine faults, can achieve better synchronization at a lower cost.},

As one can easily imagine, any serious contribution to the advance of the Internet of Things must necessarily be the result of synergetic activities conducted in different fields of knowledge, such as telecommunications, informatics, electronics and social science. In such a complex scenario, this survey is directed to those who want to approach this complex discipline and contribute to its development. Different visions of this Internet of Things paradigm are reported and enabling technologies reviewed. What emerges is that still major issues shall be faced by the research community.

	Abstract = {Ubiquitous sensing enabled by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across many areas of modern day living. This offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban environments. The proliferation of these devices in a communicating--actuating network creates the Internet of Things (IoT), wherein sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fueled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling wireless technologies such as RFID tags and embedded sensor and actuator nodes, the IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is the next revolutionary technology in transforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need for data-on-demand using sophisticated intuitive queries increases significantly. This paper presents a Cloud centric vision for worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT research in the near future are discussed. A Cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public Clouds is presented. We conclude our IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of WSN, the Internet and distributed computing directed at technological research community.},

MPI is very successful and is the dominant programming model for highly scalable programs in computational science. The fastest parallel computers in the world, with more than 200,000 cores, run programs written in MPI, and the fastest applications (achieving over 1 PetaFLOPs in 2010) use MPI. MPI was created in two stages. The original MPI standard [7], developed between 1992 and 1994, specified a library interface for point-to-point and collective communication, along with various support routines and other features. The second stage, from 1995 to 1997, extended MPI to include parallel I/O, remote memory access, and creation of additional processes, among other features.},

We argue that the currently accepted decompositions and static representations used in such research are wrong. We argue for a shift to a process based model, with a decomposition based on task achieving behaviors as the organizational principle. In particular we advocate building robotic insects.},

Then, we discuss how these characteristics are likely to impact dramatically on the very way software systems are modelled and engineered. In particular, we appear to be on the edge of a radical shift of paradigm, which is about to change our very attitudes in software systems modelling and engineering.},

Here we propose a formal definition of an autonomous agent which clearly distinguishes a software agent from just any program. We also offer the beginnings of a natural kinds taxonomy of autonomous agents, and discuss possibilities for further classification. Finally, we discuss subagents and multiagent systems.

The project gave rise to a preliminary version of Prolog at the end of 1971 and a more definitive version at the end of 1972. This article gives the history of this project and describes in detail the preliminary and then the final versions of Prolog. The authors also felt it appropriate to describe the Q-systems because it was a language that played a prominent part in Prolog's genesis.},

An axiomatisation of a problem domain is a program for solving problems in that domain. Individual problems are posed as theorems to be proved. Proofs are computations generated by the theorem-prover which executes the program incorporated in the axioms. Our thesis is that predicate logic is a useful and practical, high-level, non-deterministic programming language with sound theoretical foundations.},

	Abstract = {Theorem-proving on the computer, using procedures based on the fund{\~{}}- mental theorem of Herbrand concerning the first-order predicate etdeulus, is examined with {\~{}} view towards improving the efticieney and widening the range of practical applicability of these procedures. A elose analysis of the process of substitution (of terms for variables), and the process of truth-functional analysis of the results of such substitutions, reveals that both processes can be combined into a single new process (called resolution), iterating which is vastty more ef[ieient than the older cyclic procedures consisting of substitution stages alternating with truth-functional analysis stages. The theory of the resolution process is presented in the form of a system of first{\textless}{\~{}}rder logic with .just one inference principle (the resolution principle). The completeness of the system is proved; the simplest proof-procedure based oil the system is then the direct im- plementation of the proof of completeness. Howew{\~{}}r, this procedure is quite inefficient, {\~{}}nd the paper concludes with a discussion of several principles (called search principles) which are applicable to the design of efficient proof-procedures employing resolution as the basle logical process.},

Based on the discussions at the workshop, papers were solicited from workshop participants and invited from leading researchers in the field. Besides presenting sound research results, the papers also present visionary statements, thought-provoking ideas, and exploratory results.
	The 27 carefully reviewed revised full papers, presented together with a motivating introduction and overview, are organized in topical sections on self-organization, self-awareness, self-awareness versus self-organization, supporting self-properties, and peer-to-peer algorithms.},

Autonomic computing, perhaps the most attractive approach to solving this problem, creates systems that can manage themselves when given high-level objectives from administrators.},

In logic, propositions are elementary statement and conclusion units; they are analyzed both as to the form, namely their syntax, and as the interpretation, namely their semantics. The relation between the syntax and the semantics is also examined in the book. The first steps in logic are credited to the Ionian and Elean philosophers and to the sophists. It is however Aristotle who is considered as the founder of logic as a science. The basic steps toward a general method based on logic that allow the statement procedures as well as manipulation of symbols, are first accomplished with the use of the resolution method, and with the use of logic directly as a logic programming language. The chapter discusses logic's basic elements, and explores the relation of and the transition from logic to logic programming.},

With the use and the development of computers in the beginning of the 1950's, it soon became clear that computers could be used, not only for arithmetical computation, but also for symbolic computation. Hence, the first arithmetical computation programs, and the first programs created to answer elementary questions and prove simple theorems, were written simultaneously. The basic steps towards a general method based on Logic, were accomplished in 1965 by Robinson and later by Kowalski and Colmerauer who made use of Logic directly as a Logic Programming language. Each chapter includes solved as well as unsolved exercises provided to help the reader assimilate the corresponding topics. The solved exercises demonstrate how to work methodically, whereas the unsolved exercises aim to stimulate the reader's personal initiative. The contents of the book are self-contained; only an elementary knowledge of analysis is required. Thus, it can be used by students in every academic year, as simply reading material, or in the context of a course. It can also be used by those who utilize Logic Programming without having any particular theoretical background knowledge of Logic, or by those simply interested in Logic and its applications in Logic Programming.},

Mobile and stationary devices will dynamically connect and coordinate to seamlessly help people in accomplishing their tasks. For this vision to become a reality, developers must build applications that constantly adapt to a highly dynamic computing environment. To make the developers' task feasible, we present a system architecture for pervasive computing, called <i>one.world</i>. Our architecture provides an integrated and comprehensive framework for building pervasive applications. It includes services, such as discovery and migration, that help to build applications and directly simplify the task of coping with constant change. We describe our architecture and its programming model and reflect on our own and others' experiences with using it.},

	Abstract = {Distributed computing is at the heart of many applications. It arises as soon as one has to solve a problem in terms of entities -- such as processes, peers, processors, nodes, or agents -- that individually have only a partial knowledge of the many input parameters associated with the problem. In particular each entity cooperating towards the common goal cannot have an instantaneous knowledge of the current state of the other entities. Whereas parallel computing is mainly concerned with 'efficiency', and real-time computing is mainly concerned with 'on-time computing', distributed computing is mainly concerned with 'mastering uncertainty' created by issues such as the multiplicity of control flows, asynchronous communication, unstable behaviors, mobility, and dynamicity. While some distributed algorithms consist of a few lines only, their behavior can be difficult to understand and their properties hard to state and prove. The aim of this book is to present in a comprehensive way the basic notions, concepts, and algorithms of distributed computing when the distributed entities cooperate by sending and receiving messages on top of an asynchronous network. The book is composed of seventeen chapters structured into six parts: distributed graph algorithms, in particular what makes them different from sequential or parallel algorithms; logical time and global states, the core of the book; mutual exclusion and resource allocation; high-level communication abstractions; distributed detection of properties; and distributed shared memory. The author establishes clear objectives per chapter and the content is supported throughout with illustrative examples, summaries, exercises, and annotated bibliographies. This book constitutes an introduction to distributed computing and is suitable for advanced undergraduate students or graduate students in computer science and computer engineering, graduate students in mathematics interested in distributed computing, and practitioners and engineers involved in the design and implementation of distributed applications. The reader should have a basic knowledge of algorithms and operating systems.},

	Abstract = {Distributed computing is an activity that is performed on a spatially distributed system. An important problem in distributed computing is to provide a user with a non-distributed view of a distributed system to implement a distributed file system that allows the client programmer to ignore the physical location of his data. The models of computation generally considered to be distributed are process models in which the computational activity is represented as the concurrent execution of sequential processes. Different process models are distinguished by the mechanism employed for inter-process communication. The process models that are most distributed are the ones in which processes communicate by message passing. A process sends a message by adding it to a message queue and another process receives the message by removing it from the queue. There are two basic complexity measures for distributed algorithms: time and message complexity. The time complexity of an algorithm measures the time needed both for message transmission and for computation within the processes. The most common measure of message complexity is the total number of messages transmitted. If messages contain on the order of a few hundred bits or more, then the total number of bits sent might be a better measure of the cost than the number of messages.},

	Abstract = {In this text, students of applied mathematics, science and engineering are introduced to fundamental ways of thinking about the broad context of parallelism. The authors begin by giving the reader a deeper understanding of the issues through a general examination of timing, data dependencies, and communication. These ideas are implemented with respect to shared memory, parallel and vector processing, and distributed memory cluster computing. Threads, OpenMP, and MPI are covered, along with code examples in Fortran, C, and Java. The principles of parallel computation are applied throughout as the authors cover traditional topics in a first course in scientific computing. Building on the fundamentals of floating point representation and numerical error, a thorough treatment of numerical linear algebra and eigenvector/eigenvalue problems is provided. By studying how these algorithms parallelize, the reader is able to explore parallelism inherent in other computations, such as Monte Carlo methods.},

	Abstract = {Logic's basic elements are unfolded in this book. The relation of and the transition from Logic to Logic Programming are analysed. With the use and the development of computers in the beginning of the 1950's, it soon became clear that computers could be used, not only for arithmetical computation, but also for symbolic computation. Hence, the first arithmetical computation programs, and the first programs created to answer elementary questions and prove simple theorems, were written simultaneously. The basic steps towards a general method based on Logic, were accomplished in 1965 by Robinson and later by Kowalski and Colmerauer who made use of Logic directly as a Logic Programming language. Each chapter includes solved as well as unsolved exercises provided to help the reader assimilate the corresponding topics. The solved exercises demonstrate how to work methodically, whereas the unsolved exercises aim to stimulate the reader's personal initiative. The contents of the book are self-contained; only an elementary knowledge of analysis is required. Thus, it can be used by students in every academic year, as simply reading material, or in the context of a course. It can also be used by those who utilize Logic Programming without having any particular theoretical background knowledge of Logic, or by those simply interested in Logic and its applications in Logic Programming.},
