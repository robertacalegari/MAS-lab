### Exercise 1

0. Inspect and understand the following classes:
    - `Behaviours`
    - `it.unibo.pikalab.jade.impl.*`
    - `TestBasicBehaivours`

1. Provide an implementation for the methods in `Behaviours` in such a way that all tests in `TestBasicBehaivours` succeed
    1. Focus on the `atomic` and `stop` behaviours, first
    1. Then focus on the `sequence` behaviour
    1. Then focus on the `any` and `all` behaviours
    1. Then focus on the `repeatWhile` and `repeatForEver` behaviours
    1. Then focus on the `send` behaviour
    1. Then focus on the `receive` behaviour
    
### Exercise 2

0. Inspect and understand the following classes:
    - `Pinger`
    - `Ponger`
    - `TestPingPong`
    
1. Provide an implementation for the `Pinger` in such a way that all tests in `TestPingPong` succeed

### Exercise 3

0. Inspect and understand the following classes:
    - `SmartPinger`
    - `Ponger`
    - `TestSmartPingPong`
    
    What are the main differences with exercise 2?
    
    > HINT: the `SmartPinger`'s and `Ponger`'s names are randomly generated in `TestSmartPingPong`
    
1. Provide an implementation for the `SmartPinger` in such a way that all tests in `TestSmartPingPong` succeed
